Can game mechanics, with minimal help from art, story, and sound, evoke emotions? Specifically, can they evoke shame? Shame is a self-conscious emotion that informs one of inadequacy, unworthiness, dishonor, or regret. In one week, we created 3 different prototypes, each with a different hypothesis on the interactions that evoke shame, and tested them. We talk about what worked (being watched is really effective), what didnâ€™t work as well (non-humanoid AI), and why, in this presentation, using our prototypes as examples.
