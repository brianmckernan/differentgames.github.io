This session will provide a brief exploration of the psychological frameworks used over the last century to explain the mind's response to extreme stress. Then we will move into the current neurochemical understanding of how the brain and body work, and how that impacts mental perception and health. There will also be time for attendees (if they're comfortable) to try some grounding techniques to get a feel for them.
